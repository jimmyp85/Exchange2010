# Active Directory Monitoring Script
J Pearman, Version 3, July 2024

## Purpose
This script has been written to run as a scheduled take and report daily on the general health of your domain controllers.

This will check and provide a pass (or true) or fail (or false) on the following:

- Network connectivity
- Services
	* DNS
	* DFS Replication
	* Intersite Messaging
	* Kerberos Key Distribution Center
	* NetLogon
	* Active Directory Domain Services

- DC Diag
	* Connectivity
	* Advertising
	* FrsEvent
	* DFSREvent
	* SysVolCheck
	* KccEvent
	* KnowsOfRoleHolders
	* MachineAccount
	* NCSecDesc
	* NetLogons
	* ObjectsReplicated
	* Replications
	* RidManager
	* Services
	* SystemLog
	* VerifyReferences
	* CheckSDRefDom
	* CheckSDRefDom
	* CheckSDRefDom
	* CrossRefValidation
	* CheckSDRefDom
	* CrossRefValidation
	* CheckSDRefDom
	* CrossRefValidation
	* LocatorCheck
	* Intersite

Once the tests have been completed an HTML report will be created and emailed to you.

This script has been written for two AD sites (as that's what I have and wrote it for) but you can take one of these out or add more as required.

Please note: You will need the Active Directory module installed on the machine you run this on. It's better not to run on a DC but rather a seperate PC/Server running the AD module.
